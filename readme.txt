== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can we setup my Payway plugin on my website =

Please read more details on https://www.payway.com/why-payway/setup

= Is Payway PCI compliant? =

Yes, Payway adheres to the latest standards of the Payment Card Industry. Our payment gateway is certified with Visa and Mastercard. Cardholder data is encrypted at the point of entry with the hosted payment page, which eliminates all unencrypted data from the merchant environment. By moving away from premise-based credit card interfaces, merchants can improve data security and remove the local system from PCI certification scope.

= Do I need to get a new merchant account if I convert to Payway? =
Our “Complete” service does include merchant account services. However, we do understand that sometimes you just need certain pieces of our service, which is why we do not require you to get a new merchant account when you choose our payment gateway.
